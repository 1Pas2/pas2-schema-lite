# pas2-schema-lite

Compose small synchronous runtime validators.

Part of **Pas2 Kit** by [1Pas2](https://github.com/1Pas2): small independent TypeScript libraries with no runtime dependencies.

## Features

- Focused API with strict TypeScript declarations.
- ESM package for Node.js 22 and later.
- Automated behavioral tests and CI on Node.js 22 and 24.

## Installation

This package is prepared for npm but is **not published to npm**. Install from a local checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1Pas2/pas2-schema-lite.git
cd pas2-schema-lite
npm ci
npm run build
npm pack
```

Install the resulting `.tgz` in your application using `npm install /path/to/package.tgz`.
The intended npm name is `@1pas2/schema-lite`; registry availability is not claimed.

## Usage

```ts
import { object, string, number, optional } from '@1pas2/schema-lite';
const user = object({name:string, age:optional(number)});
console.log(user({name:'Ada', age:30}));
```

The checked-in example imports the local build. After building, run it with `node --experimental-strip-types examples/basic.ts` on a compatible Node.js release. Network and filesystem examples perform the operations shown.

## API and behavior

Schemas are functions that return validated data or throw TypeError with a path. string, number and boolean are strict; number rejects NaN and Infinity. optional(schema), array(schema), object(shape) compose validators. object strips undeclared keys and reads own properties only. No coercion, unions, async validation or aggregated errors.

The complete public types are in [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) and generated in `dist/index.d.ts`.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run check:examples
npm pack --dry-run
```

Tests use the built-in Node.js test runner against the compiled public API. Runtime dependencies: none. Development dependencies: TypeScript and Node.js type declarations. This initial release has a deliberately small scope; review its documented limits before production use.
